# Yeah, I know Linux #

When I was in 7th grade I played around with Linux for the first time, that was in 2004 I think. I helped out at a computer company, and there was a box on which was written "Suse Linux 9.2". At least I think it was version 9.2, let's make it 9.2 +- 2.
I asked my boss if I could take this home to try it out. "Why, Sure!" was his answer. So I ran home, installed the whole thing, which was quite intuitiv. After a few weeks experimenting with it, and reading about different distributions at *work* (since I didn't have internet access at home), I decided to try Gentoo Linux. It was a mess. With help of the documentation I got it successfully installed, but didn't understand much of what I did.
As a teenager you have some other important things to attend to despite computers, so some time passed.
Next winter, I got an installation CD-ROM of Debian GNU/Linux in my hands, maybe it were more like 5 CDs (remember I couldn't use netinst + I didn't own a DVD-Drive).
For some reason, I liked Debian the most. So far I did a dual installation everytime I played with Linux. But after a month with Debian, in which I never even booted into Windows, I thought it would be cool to have more diskspace. Goodbye Windows!

From that time on, Linux was my primary operating system. I tried Fedora, Arch, Ubuntu, Slackware, Gentoo and many of the smaller derivates.

Arch was nice, but I didn't like the "all in one file" thing. Which made it different from other distributions, and wasn't even totally true.
Gentoo was cool, because you *tweaked* everything, played around here and there, but somehow all the tweaking wasn't really worth it.
I didn't like Ubuntu, never thought about why. I just don't care about it very much.

I never understood a reason for distributions like "we just take distribution X change a nice icon theme use Firefox instead of Konqueror and give our new distribution a fancy name".
It's basically the same distribution, just other programs in it. You don't eed to create new ISO's, which you need to host on some server or share over Bittorrent. That's not really "new" distribution. It's just a distribution, and you installed the software that you liked.
You can create a package for that, can't you? You could write a script which does these changes. Why create a "new" distribution, with all the overhead.

Now well, a *distribution* is nothing else like a collection of software (and so on), collected together to *distribute*. So, maybe the term is correct. But you get my point, right?
If you really make heavy changes, using another package manager/format, try to place configuration files in totally different places, use another kernel or whatever. I get it if you call that a distribution.
But if you just take a vanilla Ubuntu, and put a dark colorscheme on it? People, that's called configuring your system.

But, of course it's a way to show off to a total newbie if you say "I even created my own distribution!".
Why, sure. Most people do that. In a sense.

## Whe have bigger problems ##

I totally agree. Like for example, when people who studied computer science, and are experts in their field (on the paper), talk like Ubuntu == Linux. Like there is no other distro.
And really an awful lot of people don't seem to be aware of that "Linux" actually the Kernel. For convenience sake I mostly use the word Linux and mean, the whole operating system. Kernel, GNU programs and all, the whole package.
It's normal to do that. But you should be aware, that technically Linux is the Kernel.

## Why did you write all this, man? ##
I have heard some really awful discussions of computer science students, admins and other experts. I am no good at writing, more so in english, but I needed to write this down. I feel a lot better now. Maybe even someone will read this, and learn something from it.

## So you are the expert, huh? ##

Definitely not! I always saw myself as a beginner. It's only recently, since nearly _everybody_ talks about Linux (and many sell themselves as experts), that I realized that I am not a total newbie anymore.
I suppose, I am a normal user now.

## I am bored by all this.. ##

Wait a minute!
I specifically searched something for **you** from my hero Richard Stallman. It's just a short talk, I only found it right now. And I think you should watch it. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK52v6bCPvg) it is.
