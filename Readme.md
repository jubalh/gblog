# Jubalhs Blog #
So, here I put some little texts, you can call them articles, which I wrote. Others maybe would publish them in form of a blog post.
Maybe I will do that if I have some time, and feel like it.
For now, I don't really see a necessity for that. Just enjoy them as they are.


If you are not used to Github (or to text files ;) ), don't get scared off by this. Calm down, and read.
