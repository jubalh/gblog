So, here I put some little texts, you can call them articles, which I wrote. Others maybe would publish them in form of a blog post.
Maybe I will do that if I have some time, and feel like it.

For now, enjoy them as they are.
If you are not used to Github (or to text files ;) ), don't get scared of by this. Calm down, an read.
